<h1>About us:</h1>
<p>The Learning manager app runs on Padrino, ActiveRecord and whatever database to manage the following:

  1. It will help learning managers manage:
  a. Students == How they learn i.e. lessons, how they pay, how they attend lessons, how they get
  certified, how they do exams...they can even check their results, payment status e.t.c
  b. Trainers == How they teach i.e. they can check their lesson allocations, how much they've earned for teaching
  track the exams they've set, check their track records in terms of student results e.t.c.
  c. Payments == The app will help the primary user track the payments coming in i.e. those made by students and the
  payments going out i.e. those made to trainers. It will be able to print receipts and even enable students
  to pay in installements.

  d. Exams/Certificates ==  The app will be able to plan exams, set them, manage students taking the exams and can even auto-mark
  the exams (against pre-defined criteria) and also issue out result slips and certificates.</p>
